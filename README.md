## Assembly Practice
This repository contains parts of the Assembly assignments I did at university with the Irvine32 library. Through this project, I practiced low-level programming.

**Implementation**: 2020-2021  
**Updated**: 2025

## C Practice
This repository includes various C assignments completed during my university studies in 2020-2021. These projects focus on core concepts such as pointers, file I/O, and linked lists.

**Implementation**: 2020-2021  
**Updated**: Soon (Explanations will be added in the future)

## Amorgos Rooms
A full-stack booking application developed for a university project using Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and JavaScript. The project features a responsive frontend with media queries for mobile compatibility. Users can book rooms, while owners manage bookings and availability.

**Implementation**: May-July 2024  
**Updated**: Soon (Explanations and improvements will be added in the future)

## Weather Data Analysis
For this university project, I developed a system that collects weather data from multiple sources using Python and Scrapy. The data is stored in TimescaleDB, and the entire process is automated using cron jobs. The project aims to compare real and predicted weather data to identify patterns and trends.

**Implementation**: Mar-July 2025  
**Updated**: Soon (Explanations and implementation will be added in the future)

## Global Terrorism Analysis
This project was implemented by a team analyzing the Global Terrorism Database using Hadoop and Java. The team processed large datasets using MapReduce jobs, providing insights into global terrorism trends and uncovering key patterns.

**Implementation**: Nov–Jan 2024  
**Updated**: Soon (Explanations will be added in the future)

## Star Wars Movies Analysis
This project was implemented by a team using MongoDB to store and process data about Star Wars movies. By running various queries, we identified interesting trends and patterns in the dataset, contributing to a deeper understanding of the movies statistics and metadata.

**Implementation**: May–July 2024   
**Updated**: Soon (Explanations will be added in the future)
