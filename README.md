## Assembly Practice
This repository contains parts of the Assembly assignments I did at university with the Irvine32 library. Through this project, I practiced low-level programming.

## C Practice
This repository includes various C assignments completed during my university studies. These projects focus on core concepts such as pointers, file I/O, and linked lists.

## Amorgos Rooms
A full-stack booking application developed for a university project using Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and JavaScript. The project features a responsive frontend with media queries for mobile compatibility. Users can book rooms, while owners manage bookings and availability. Although the project is complete, there are plans to make further improvements in the future.

## Weather Data Analysis
For this university project, I developed a system that collects weather data from multiple sources using Python and Scrapy. The data is stored in TimescaleDB, and the entire process is automated using cron jobs. The project aims to compare real and predicted weather data to identify patterns and trends.

## Global Terrorism Analysis
This project was implemented by a team analyzing the Global Terrorism Database using Hadoop and Java. The team processed large datasets using MapReduce jobs, providing insights into global terrorism trends and uncovering key patterns.

## Star Wars Movies Analysis
This project was implemented by a team using MongoDB to store and process data about Star Wars movies. By running various queries, we identified interesting trends and patterns in the dataset, contributing to a deeper understanding of the movies statistics and metadata.
